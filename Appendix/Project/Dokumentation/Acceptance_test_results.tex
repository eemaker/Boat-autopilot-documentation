\chapter{Acceptance test results}
\label{sec:acceptance_test_results}

This section is an execution of the acceptance test defined in section~\ref{sec:acceptance_test} on page~\pageref{sec:acceptance_test}.

The test was performed outside with access to a GPS connection, but it was not performed in a pool of water. The pool of water was considered unnecessary, since the boat is difficult to retrieve after testing, and there is a risk of capsizing, which can result in all of the electronics shorting and getting destroyed. Also a very large amount of time is also required to tune the PID loop so the boat will behave in a predictable manner. Therefore the test was conducted by carrying the boat and following its directions, meaning if it turns the rudder left we move the boat right an vice versa.

A WiFi connection was setup for the Raspberry pi inside the boat, called "\texttt{WindowsAP}" which it is setup to connect to with the password "\texttt{1i3J804\^}". When a connection is gained, the website can be reached by navigating to either the ip assigned or "\texttt{http://rasp\-berry\-pi.\-local}" which is the host name. Between each test the website is refreshed to clear any cached data, like inputted coordinates, and also to reset the buttons for calculating start and so forth.

		1 & Input coordinate for point "1" by writing it in the input fields "longitude" and "latitude" & The map indicates the position and labels it "1" to indicate the starting position of the coverage, the input fields for the position update correspondingly & A marker labeled "1" appears on the map corresponding to the inputted longitude and latitude & Passed\\ \hline
		2 & Input coordinate for point "2" by writing it in the input fields "longitude" and "latitude" & The map indicates the position and labels it "2" to indicate the end position of the coverage, the input fields for the position update correspondingly & A marker labeled "2" appears on the map corresponding to the inputted longitude and latitude, and a orange square between the points are also drawn. & Passed \\ \hline

		3 & Press the "Calculate path" button in the user interface & The button should change text to "Calculating..." for a while, while it is calculating, After calculating the calculated path should be displayed on the map, from the boat to the endpoint covering the selected area. Also after calculating, the "Calculating..." button should change to "Start" & The button changes to "Calculating.." for a while, then a path is drawn on the map, and the button changes to "Start". & Passed\\ \hline
		4 & Press the "Start" button in the user interface & The button should change to "Running...", and the boat starts moving and keeps on doing so until it has completed the coverage of the area chosen in the first step, also while the boat is moving the ETE on the user interface is continually updated with an approximate ETE. On the map the icon of the boat should also change to correspond with the real position of the boat. After the boat is at the endpoint the "Running..." button should change to "Calculate path" & The button changes to "Running..." and while the path is being traversed, the ETE is updated continually along with the boat's position. & Passed \\ \hline

The boats turns off its motors and comes to a halt. & The button changes to "Calculate path" when stop is pressed, and the motors are stopped. The progress bare turns red and "Cancelled" is displayed & Passed\\ \hline
