\chapter{Requirements specification}

The requirements for the product are prioritized using the MoSCoW method. Using this, the requirements for the product are divided into four sections, where the most important elements are given the highest priority. \textbf{Must} are the requirements that are an absolute necessity for the product. \textbf{Should} are the requirements that are also of high priority, but not quite mandatory. \textbf{Could} are requirements which may be met, if the time and other constraints of the project allow for it. \textbf{Won't} are the requirements the product will not meet, but could be developed at a later point in its lifetime.  

\noindent The following priorities have been chosen for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Must}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Navigate waypoints from user input
			\item Be compatible with NMEA protocol GPS input
			\item Use GPS for localization
			\item Implement a PID control loop
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Should}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Control thrusters in two-thruster catamaran
			\item Use a graphical user interface for user interaction
			\item Be able to change the PID parameters
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Could}] 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Control wheel in outboard motor on boat
			\item Be generic enough to use with other engine types
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Won't}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use pylogon-coverage for a specified area
			\item Avoid obstacles
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Mockups}
\label{sec:mockups}
To get a better understanding of what the system would require, some user interface mockups were created. 
The first of which, describe how there should be the ability to edit and change different parameters of the system, on figure~\ref{fig:mockup:edit_param}, it is seen how a profile 1 contains parameters for a PID. There is also the ability to create new profiles and change which on is the currently active one.

To describe a collection a parameters and to be able to switch the active one, there is a need for a term like a parameter profile.
This parameter profile is just a collection of parameters, and a name. It makes it easy to save different parameters and easily switch between them.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Mockup for Edit parameter menu}
	\label{fig:mockup:edit_param}
\end{figure}

The mockup in figure~\ref{fig:mockup:p2p} is describing how the user may define a waypoint for the boat to navigate. There is the ability of entering the coordinates by hand or by pressing the map. Also this page of the system allows the user to tell the ship to calculate a path with which to follow. An estimated time of arrival is also displayed.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Point_to_point.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Point to point menu}
	\label{fig:mockup:p2p}
\end{figure}

There is also a mockup that describes how the user should define a rectangle to cover, seen in figure~\ref{fig:mockup:coverage}. like to the point to point menu mockup, there is a way to enter coordinates of the rectangle manually or by pressing the map. In every other regard this menu is just like the point to point menu.

	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Coverage.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Coverage menu}
	\label{fig:mockup:coverage}
\end{figure}

Lastly there is a menu describe by the mockup on figure~\ref{fig:mockup:diagnostics} that show how the user of the system might see diagnostics data about the boat at any given time. The idea is that the boxes of information are interchangeable so if more information is required in the future is is easy to adapt the user interface.

The following two diagrams specify the actor context to the system, and the use cases for the system.

\section{Actors}
The following section describes the system's actors. Every actor has a type and a short description of its function and impact on the system. On figure~\ref{fig:actor} the actor context diagram is described. Actors on the left are primary actors, and on the right they are secondary actors.

	\subsubsection*{Type:}
	Primary

\section{Fully dressed Use cases }
\label{sec:usecases}
Use cases are used to describe the intended use of a system. When a system has a user interface, use cases make a lot of sense since for every action a user or actor has there should be some feedback of some kind. To get an overview of all the use cases a use case diagram can be created, it shows all primary and secondary actors of a system, an also which use cases they are involved in, as well as which they initiate, this is show with an arrow on figure~\ref{fig:usecasediagram}.

For each use case there is defined a goal, and a way to get to that goal, via the main scenario. There can be defined some prerequisites, that must be how the use case defines for the user to get the expected result. Also there might be extensions or exceptions that deviate from the main scenario. They also describe what actors are involved and what their role is. If a use case uses another use case there can be found a reference.
