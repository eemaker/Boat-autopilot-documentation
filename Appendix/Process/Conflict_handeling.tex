\chapter{Conflict handling}
When we started working on this project, we created a requirements specification, for the project that we thought was the one we were supposed to make. It was based on a meeting with EIVA and the problem description that we got in the pre bachelor project. When we sent this requirements specification to EIVA which we worked for at that point, we didn't receive any feedback for week. After this week we ended up calling them and not getting a response the first time. When we finally got a hold of them, they explained that they were very busy at the moment, but that we could arrange a meeting at the "EIVA days" at Aarhus harbour. We then got there in the morning an waited till the afternoon before they had time to meet us. It turned out that there were some major misunderstandings on our part, with regards to what they meant by an autopilot system. This was very frustrating for us, so we ended up talking with our supervisor. We ended up continuing with the project that we specified in the requirements specification, and ended the collaboration with EIVA. 

We also had one internal conflict in the middle of the project. This conflict was based around differing perspectives on work planning and managements. We solved the conflict, at a meeting where we ended up discussing it. The discussion ended up in a renewed expectations on how we were to work together.
