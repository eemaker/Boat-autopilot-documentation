\chapter{Meetings}
During this project, there has never been any kind of structure to when and how we have had meetings. Meetings with our supervisor have been few and far between. Usually meetings were arranged by sending an email asking if a time in the near future would be possible. All of our supervisor meetings have been at our supervisor's office, and they usually involved showing how far we had gotten since the previous meeting, and asking a few relevant questions. 

Internal meetings in the group has been very informal. In the beginning of the project we met almost every day to work on the project, but the further into the project we got the less often we met to work together. Deciding what should be accomplished at the meetings was usually discussed in advance.
