\chapter{Meetings}
During this project, there has never been any kind of structure to when and how we have been during meetings. Meetings with out supervisor has been few and far between. Usually meetings were arrange by sending an email asking if a time in the near future would be possible. All of out supervisor meetings have been at our supervisors office. They usually involved showing how far we have got, and asking a few questions. 

Internal meetings in the group has been very informal. In the beginning of the project we met almost everyday to work on the project, but the further into the project we got the less ofter we met to work together. Deciding what should be accomplished at the meetings are usually discussed in advanced.
