%Her beskrives hvordan gruppen er dannet. Er I sammensat af semesterkoordinatoren, er I sammensat helt tilfældigt, er I sammensat på basis af personlighedsprofiler – eller har I haft kendskab til hinanden i forvejen?
\chapter{Group formation}
For the bachelor project, it was each person's own responsibility to find a partner or group to be a part of. Additionally, it was required to find a project from the list of projects in the university intranet, which companies had sent to AU. This generally resulted in students finding someone they had worked with before or knew from another class, and picking a project from the list they would be interested in working on. 

For our group, we had worked together a year earlier on another project, an autonomous car with several sensors. Since we both had interest in autonomous vehicles, and had taken an autonomous robotics course in the spring of 2017, we decided to pursue the Boat autopilot project put up by EIVA. 

Despite being Electrical Engineering students, we were and are more interested in software development than circuit design, and since this project turned out to contain mostly software, this seems to have been a good fit for us both.
