%Her beskrives planlægning, herunder hvordan den tidmæssige aspekt i projektet er planlagt. Anvendte værktøjer til planlægningen kan beskrives her, f. eks. Gantt-diagrammer – eller, hvis I har anvendt Scrum kan planlægning af Sprints beskrives her.
\chapter{Planning}
The planning of the this project has been rather loose. We didn't make  Gantt-diagrams or other kinds of schedules. Early on we did use some time trying to figure out what the project would encompass, and we made a MoSCoW, to help prioritize the project and our time.

We have had two major deadlines that we have worked up toward. The first one was for some hardware design, that we never did end up completing, or barely working on, therefore instead some off-the-shelf components were bought. The second deadline was the deadline for being done with all documentation and writing in general. This deadline also dictated when the product needed to be finished, since an acceptance test needed to be completed before the three project documents could be fully written. 

We learned how to prioritize tasks on the fly throughout the project, and because of this, and maybe a bit of luck, we ended up completing all parts of the project in the end.
