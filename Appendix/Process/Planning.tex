%Her beskrives planlægning, herunder hvordan den tidmæssige aspekt i projektet er planlagt. Anvendte værktøjer til planlægningen kan beskrives her, f. eks. Gantt-diagrammer – eller, hvis I har anvendt Scrum kan planlægning af Sprints beskrives her.
\chapter{Planning}
The planning of the this project has been rather loose. We didn't make any kind of Gantt-diagrams or other kind of schedule. Early on we did use some time trying to figure out what the project would encompass, and we made a MoSCoW, to help prioritize the project and our time.

We have had two major deadlines that we have worked up toward. The first one was for some hardware design, that we never did end up completing, or barely working on, therefore instead some off the shelf components were bought. The second deadline was the deadline for being done with all documentation and writing in general. This deadline also dictated when the product needed to be finished since an acceptance test needed to be completed before everything can be written. 

In the end we ended up maybe being lucky that the project got completed, since we did not plan what to work on when. But it might also just be because, we learned to prioritize on the fly throughout the project.
