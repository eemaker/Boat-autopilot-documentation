\chapter{Requirements specification}

The requirements for the product are prioritized using the MoSCoW method. Using this, the requirements for the product are divided into four sections, where the most important elements are given the highest priority. \textbf{Must} are the requirements that are an absolute necessity for the product. \textbf{Should} are the requirements that are also of high priority, but not quite mandatory. \textbf{Could} are requirements which may be met, if the time and other constraints of the project allow for it. \textbf{Won't} are the requirements the product will not meet, but could be developed at a later point in its lifetime.  

\noindent The following priorities have been chosen for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Must}]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Navigate waypoints from user input
		\item Be compatible with NMEA protocol GPS input
		\item Use GPS for localization
		\item Implement a PID control loop
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Should}]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Control thrusters in two-thruster catamaran
		\item Use a graphical user interface for user interaction
		\item Be able to change the PID parameters
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Could}] 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Control wheel in outboard motor on boat
		\item Be generic enough to use with other engine types
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Won't}]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use pylogon-coverage for a specified area
		\item Avoid obstacles
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:rich_image} below shows an illustration of the usage scenario for the Boat autopilot system. A technician or a user accesses the system using an interface. This interface communicates with the system using wireless communication, and the system performs the appropriate actions, for example following a curved path to cover a specified area. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Introduction/rich_image}
	\caption{Rich image}
	\label{fig:rich_image}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:general_sd} shows a general, and simplified, sequence of events for the system.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Introduction/General_SD}
	\caption{General sequence diagram}
	\label{fig:general_sd}
\end{figure}

At this point it seemed appropriate to consider the design of the user interface because it describes how the actors interact with the system, which makes it possible to specify the Use cases of the system. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Edit_param.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Edit parameter menu}
	\label{fig:mockupparam}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mockupparam} shows the Edit Param menu of the user interface. As seen in the UI, the technician can create and edit new profiles for the Controller, and set which one is actively running in the control loop. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Point_to_point.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Point to point menu}
	\label{fig:mockupp2p}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mockupp2p} shows the Point to point menu of the user interface. In this menu, the user can specify a destination either on a map or by inputting coordinates, then ask the system to calculate a path there, and finally to proceed to the destination. If needed, the user can also stop the boat.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Diagnostics.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Diagnostics menu}
	\label{fig:mockupdiag}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mockupdiag} shows the Diagnostics menu of the user interface. Here, the system status is shown to make troubleshooting easier.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/UI_Mockup_Coverage.pdf}
	\caption{Mockup for Coverage menu}
	\label{fig:mockupcover}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mockupcover} shows the Coverage menu of the user interface. Here, the user can specify two opposing edges of a rectangle for the system to cover. The user can then ask the system to calculate a curved path through this area, and finally to proceed. There is, like in the Point to point menu, a stop function for convenience.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{Images/Requirements_specification/Actor_context_diagram}
	\caption{Actor context diagram}
	\label{fig:actorcontextdiagram}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:actorcontextdiagram} shows an actor context diagram for the system. The technician and the user are primary actors, and the GPS is a secondary actor.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Images/Requirements_specification/Usecase_diagram}
	\caption{Use case diagram}
	\label{fig:usecasediagram}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:usecasediagram} shows the use cases for the system, and the arrows show which actors are involved in each. The use cases are broadly based on the UI mockups.
