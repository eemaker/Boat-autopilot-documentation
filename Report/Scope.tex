\chapter{Scope}
The scope of this project has been analyzed with the use of the MoSCoW method. This method is used to make a priority list of what should be worked on in the project. The method is separated into four levels of priority; \textbf{Must}, \textbf{Should}, \textbf{Could}, and \textbf{Won't}.

\noindent The following priorities have been chosen for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Must}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Navigate waypoints from user input
			\item Be compatible with NMEA protocol GPS input
			\item Use GPS for localization
			\item Implement a PID control loop
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Should}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Control thrusters in two-thruster catamaran
			\item Use a graphical user interface for user interaction
			\item Be able to change the PID parameters
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Could}] 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Control wheel in outboard motor on boat
			\item Be generic enough to use with other engine types
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Won't}]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use polygon-coverage for a specified area
			\item Avoid obstacles
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
