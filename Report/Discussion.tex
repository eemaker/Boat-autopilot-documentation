\chapter{Discussion}
This section is a discussion of the results from section 11. 

All functionality of the system has been verified in the acceptance test. However, as mentioned earlier, the project scope was so big that many hard choices had to be made underway to achieve this result.

Throughout the project development, time was generally allocated towards finishing the basic functionality of all sub-components rather than developing modules that were "nice to have" or gave some funcitonality beyond the bare-bones requirements. This was inevitable, and looking back, the team is pleased with the prioritization that was made, since there turned out to be no extra time available.

The development team is overall pleased with the final product, and with having learned a great deal about tests, component choices, software design, and taking responsibility of the full development cycle as a small team. 

Making a wide variety of modules in several different languages all work together as intended was very satisfying, since it indicates that our decision to value generality and extendability over a full production-level implementation of the system (which we wouldn't have been able to finish in time) paid off.
