This preliminary work has provided a good foundation on which to build the system, and we're satisfied with our project plan as detailed in the corresponding section. Many of the specifics are subject to change during the course of development, but having a starting point is essential prior to beginning the development process. Several relevant sources have been found, that could aid us in choosing technologies, algorithms, hardware, and problem solving. We're confident that the chosen development models, along with AGILE workflow, will lead to a succesful outcome.
